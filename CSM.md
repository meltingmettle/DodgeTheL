 
    To you it has been given knowledge of the mystery, but for others they are in parables, 
    so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.

Hello there!

I'm glad you're here!  Please apply if you know my voice!
I know that the midterm is coming up, and that section doesn't start until after midterm 1.
Let not your hearts be troubled.  I am preparing a place for you! 
Those who are excelling have no need of a teacher, but those who are struggling. 

You can catch me at DL or in the Chaos Compound.  
We'll be doing tutoring and review sessions from now until the midterm!



My goal is not for you to do well in this class.

I would like you to do well enough in this class such that you have time to think about things that actually matter.
I want you to do well in this class, well in this semester, well in this year, the rest of your life, and everything after that.
A loft objective, indeed, so I'm going to need your help on this.

What is doing well?
The standard that you apply will be the standard that you recieve. 
A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be given to you. 

I'll catch you later!
