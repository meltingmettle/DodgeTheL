# Advice for the ED/WWPD section:

1. Stick to the plan, and remember the rules.  

2. For Environment Diagrams, I liked to do them on scratch paper, then copy them over after.  It gives you a double check option, and it's faster than erasing the whole thing if you make a mistake or two.  

3. Do the most rational thing when it's confusing.  Make your best guess, and see if it works out.  The previous helps with that.  

4. If a variable is undefinded in a frame, look at the parent frame until you find it.  

You can add notations to help you remember things if there's a lot of repeptitive naming.  

    mask3 = mask1(mask2)(mask2)
    horse = horse(mask2)

instead of 

    mask = mask(mask(mask))
    horse = horse(mask)
    
5.  Remember that a function call needs parameters.  Whenever you see the ____(input),__ you need to open a frame, because that's a function call.  If there are no ()'s, it's not a function call.

# Advice for the free-coding:
Solve the problem in English, then convert your words to code.  (IE:"look through the array until we find the element and compare it to the one that we passed i" -> "use a for loop to go through the array and an if statement to compare elemnts"....etc)

Don't get too caught up on coding from the start, as the code will come naturally if you understand the problem well enough.
Worse case, go for psuedocode. 

    def search(x):
        total = 0
        for loop of all the elements in the array: #forgot how to do a for loop
          total += 1
        return total


# Strategy for dummies
The test is out of 40 points. About 20 are in the first half of the test, namely WWPD and Environment Diagrams.
These are considered the "easy" points.  If you do enough practice of these, you can predictably get ~90% on this part.  
Average 20/40, and boom.  Safe B-, possibly B.

For WWPD, play around with python in your console, specifically with True/False, and, or, 10, 3, list operators, list indexing, and such.  It will pay off.  Make sure you know the rules and edge cases.  (EX:  what would list x[-2] return?)(What are the numbers in range(5,15))?

** GO FOR PARTIAL **
If you have the slightest idea of what's going on, write it down and try your best.  2 points is significant. (Again, out of 40, and the average is around 20)

Spend enough time to get about 100%, or as much as you can on the first half, then try to do the coding questions.

Take your time to read the question and write as much as you can; one complete question is better than two half-filled and better than three "n > 0" panic scribbles.

# Chill. 
It's going to be good! Take a mental break around an hour before the test to rest! 


Keep me updated on how you're doing!!

Advice from a time which has already passed

# You might have screwed up.
But you have time! If you do one practice test every day until Thursday, you will be more than fine. :)
(Assuming you actually take the whole two hours, challenge yourself, and understand the problems when you review. )

Check out Environment Diagrams and How To Approach Coding Problems. (Under the DodgeTheL repository)

I personally wouldn't go to Guerilla Sections or Office Hours because they're very crowded and helpful about 60% of the time. 
Text the Good Teacher, Alan Kwok, aka the Great Titanium Chef, or myself.  Or come to DL or Dana House! :D

Unless you straight don't know the material, don't waste time watching lecture or doing review sheets.
Just get started on practice tests.

# Find help. :) 

There's GP Sessions:
Monday night at DL, 7-9
Wednesday night, either DH or DL, TBD

There are a plethora of review session and uppers who can help you out! Don't feel stuck.  Ask for help, do reviews and practice tests, get stuck, and keep working at it.  

It's going to be good.  

Long story short, do a lot of practice tests.
