    so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.


# Hello there!

I'm glad you're here!  Please apply if you know my voice!  <br />
<br />
I know that the midterm is coming up, and that section doesn't start until after midterm 1. <br />
Let not your hearts be troubled.  I am preparing a place for you!  <br />
Those who are excelling have no need of a teacher, but those who are struggling.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You can catch me at DL or in the Chaos Compound.   <br />
We'll be doing tutoring and review sessions from now until the midterm!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My goal is not for you to do well in this class.<br />
<br />
I would like you to do well enough in this class such that you have time to think about things that actually matter.  <br />
I want you to do well in this class, well in this semester, well in this year, the rest of your life, and everything after that.  <br />
A loft objective, indeed, so I'm going to need your help on this.  <br />

<br />
<br />
What is doing well? <br />
The standard that you apply will be the standard that you recieve. <br />
A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be given to you. <br />
<br />
I'll catch you later!
