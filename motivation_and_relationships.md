# Motivation and Growing in Relationships 

    Motivation such an aggravation
    Accusations, don't know how to take 'em
    Inspiration, getting hard to fake it
    Concentration, never hard to break it
    Situation never what you want it to be
         ~SUM 41

Over Sophomore/Junior retreat this last Fall, Pastor Ed noted how the over-use of the mobile phone and addiction to internet usage 
had a tendency to sop up free time and decrement our ability to take the time to invest in our peers or take time to have 
a long and meaningful conversation. 

In addition to this, phones and applications with colorful, intermittent rewards and infinite-scroll features further detract from 
our relationships and wise use of discretionary time.  


An experience that stood out to me the Friday before retreat was a conversation I had with one of my peers. (The one who can be named in four letters)(You know who you are)
Being done with 70 homework, and LateX-ing with a fairly free afternoon, I ran into one of my peers who was waiting in the foyer of DL.  Turns out he was waiting for a bus to Northside, and I was expecting a 5 minute conversation of "yo" and "alright later mate".


The opposite ended up following, with a nearly 45-minute conversation spanning our semesters, struggles to budget time, and general challenges of living out a Christ-centered life.  I was really blessed by the time that we had to talk, and I was incredibly grateful that I had somehow managed to finish my work early and allocate such a siginificant amount of time on the fly.  


**My approach is as such:**

Work now and get it done.  Doesn't matter how long or how short.  Assume that you are going to run into someone who needs to talk in two hours or one of your peers is going to get sick and need help on the project, or your high school friend is going to call you for help that afternoon. 
By focusing on "soft" tasks that need to get done which both benefit other people and add a bit of pressure to your schedule,
you can find that extra dose of motivation that you couldn't find from inside yourself. 

If you have a paper which you can do in an hour, get it done efficiently and use the extra time after to read or hang out with your peers.  

If you have one more lab problem left, finish it, and go find someone who is stuck.

Fight the urge to click-trawl through the interwebs in the security that you're pretty much done with all your work.

Procrastinating is not only a waste of time and bad habit, but you'll end up backing yourself into a corner where you are unable to use opportunities to be a blessing to the people around you. 

In the long run, budgeting time in a manner which just barely meets the mark and leaves no consideration for your community is selfish and, as Tony Stark would say, not a great plan.
