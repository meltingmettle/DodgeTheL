    In the beginning was the Word
      the Word was with God
      and the Word was God.
      
      He was in the beginning with God. 
      All things were made through him, 
      and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
      
      In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 
      The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
      
      
# There are four steps that I generally approach free-coding problems with.

    1. Read and fully understand the question
    2. Solve the question in English
    3. Convert snippets of your solution into code
    4. Fit snippets into the lines and fill in the rest
    
Sounds easy yes?

Note that there are two facets to this method.  One is understanding a solution, and the other is the coding skills to implement it.


1.  Sounds obvious, but you'd be suprised how often this is overlooked.  
You should be able to create a test case/example
DO NOT panic code.  That will not work. :P   

  
2.  Again, don't get caught up in the "oh crap" of a tough coding problem with a ton of lines and seemingly useless  
starter code.

3.  If you see a condition, make an if.  If there's something that needs to be stored, assign a variable.  If you need to look through a list, use a for loop.  If you need to recurse, throw in the base case.

4.  This part is tricky.  Go for partial XD


# If you're stuck
1. Look at the doc tests
2. Look at the line structure. Make sure you've assigned all the variables and made enough return statements
3. Make sure you're using all the input variables.  They never pass in values for lols :P
