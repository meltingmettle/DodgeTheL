# You might have screwed up.
But you have time! If you do one practice test every day until Thursday, you will be more than fine. :)
(Assuming you actually take the whole two hours, challenge yourself, and understand the problems when you review. )

Check out Environment Diagrams and How To Approach Coding Problems. (Under the DodgeTheL repository)

I personally wouldn't go to Guerilla Sections or Office Hours because they're very crowded and helpful about 60% of the time. 
Text the Good Teacher, Alan Kwok, aka the Great Titanium Chef, or myself.  Or come to DL or Dana House! :D

Unless you straight don't know the material, don't waste time watching lecture or doing review sheets.
Just get started on practice tests.

# Strategy for dummies
The test is out of 40 points. About 20 are in the first half of the test, namely WWPD and Environment Diagrams.
These are considered the "easy" points.  If you do enough practice of these, you can predictably get ~90% on this part.  
Average 20/40, and boom.  Safe B-, possibly B.

For WWPD, play around with python in your console, specifically with True/False, and, or, 10, 3, list operators, list indexing, and such.  It will pay off.  Make sure you know the rules and edge cases.  (EX:  what would list x[-2] return?)(What are the numbers in range(5,15))?

** GO FOR PARTIAL **
If you have the slightest idea of what's going on, write it down and try your best.  2 points is significant. (Again, out of 40, and the average is around 20)


# Find help. :) 
There are a plethora of review session and uppers who can help you out! Don't feel stuck.  Ask for help, do reviews and practice tests, get stuck, and keep working at it.  

It's going to be good.  

Long story short, do a lot of practice tests.
